## Usage

The easiest way to use this image is by adding a Dockerfile to your repository's `.devcontainer` folder and extending `sommerfeldio/devcontainer`.

```Dockerfile
FROM sommerfeldio/devcontainer:latest
LABEL maintainer="sebastian@sommerfeld.io"
```

This `sommerfeldio/devcontainer` image is based on [`mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:ubuntu-24.04`](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/devcontainers) and is configured to run as the non-root user `vscode` by default. File permissions and mounted volumes will be owned and accessed by the `vscode` user (uid = `1000`, gid = `1000`).

```json
{
    "name": "project-name",
    "build": {
        "dockerfile": "Dockerfile"
    },

    "customizations": {
        "vscode": {
            "settings": {},
            "extensions": [
                "ms-azuretools.vscode-docker",
                "github.vscode-github-actions",
                "redhat.vscode-yaml"
            ]
        }
    },

    "features": {
        "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/docker-in-docker:2.12.0": {}
    }
}
```

This approach provides several benefits:

- Ensures that pipelines can validate the Devcontainer setup.
- Allows Dependabot to track updates.
- Makes it easy to extend the image with additional tools as needed.
