# Project and Repository Structure

## Filesystem Structure
This is the structure of the repository with the most important directories and files. There is of course more in the repository, but the important parts are listed here.

```
+--+  docs
|  +---  contents              # Actual documentation
|  +---  site                  # Generated HTML based on Markdown (ignored from git)
+--+  components
|  +---  <image-1>             # A Docker image
|  +---  <image-2>             # A Docker image
|  +---  <image-3>             # A Docker image
|  +---  ...                   # ...
+---  docker-compose.yml       # Docker Compose file with the toolchain (e.g. for local development)
```

## Pipeline
The build pipeline is triggered by a commit to any branch in the repository. But not all branches are treated equally. The `main` branch is the most important branch in the repository. It is the branch that is always deployable and is the branch that is used to deploy to production. Other branches use a subset of the pipeline to ensure that they can be merged into the `main` branch and are are in a deployable state.

### Docker Scout Scan
We use the `docker-scout` tool to scan the Docker image for vulnerabilities. The tool is run as part of the Docker image build process in out pipeline. The tool is configured not to break the build, but to provide a report of the vulnerabilities found in the image. The report is then used to decide if the image is safe or if it needs to be fixed.
