## Usage

To use the image run the following command.

```bash
docker run -it --rm --volume "$(pwd):$(pwd)" --workdir "$(pwd)" sommerfeldio/folderslint:latest
```

To use in a Github Actions workflow, use the following snippet.

```yaml
lint-folders:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Run folderslint in container
      run: docker run -i --rm --volume "$(pwd):$(pwd)" --workdir "$(pwd)" sommerfeldio/folderslint:latest
```

The image expects a `.folderslintrc` file inside `--workdir` (which typically is the project-root). The file can be used to configure the rules for the directory structure validation in JSON.

```json
{
 "rules": [
  ".devcontainer",
  ".github/workflows",
  ".vscode",

  "app",
  "app/folder",
  "app/folder/sub-folder",
  "app/folder/sub-folder/**",

  "docs/**",

  "node_modules/**",
  "target/**"
 ]
}
```
