This project contains a collection of Docker images for various purposes. The images are built and published to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/sommerfeldio) and are used in different projects. All images can be used standalone, they do not depend on any other image or service.

The images are free to use for everyone. But keep in mind that they were originally created to align with the requirements of [sommerfeld.io](https://github.com/sommerfeld-io) projects. We mostly use them in Github Actions workflows. But running them locally or outside of GitHub Actions is also possible.
