# AI Prompt

Create a clean, modern illustration symbolizing a collection of Docker containers, without using any text or logos. Use abstract, simplified icons—such as grouped cube-like objects, modular blocks, or stylized containers—that clearly suggest multiple standalone Docker containers. Render exactly four container icons, each styled as an icon-level representation of a container.

All icons should have consistent spacing between them, and the overall layout must appear symmetrical and visually balanced. The composition should suggest modularity and variety, while maintaining a clean, cohesive look.

Use a transparent background. The filling color of each container icon should be #1E2129. Use #5e8bde for borders and edges, and apply #ff6e42 sparingly as a subtle highlight to accent key features.

All icons should look the same (save for some orange highlights). And all icons should be displayed in 1 line.

The visual style should be flat or subtly dimensional, suitable for the start page of a documentation website. Avoid traditional branding elements—do not include the Docker whale or logo. Focus entirely on cubicle-style forms that communicate the concept of containerization through visual structure and arrangement.
